Paint Nest, a Business to Consumer (B2C) E-commerce paints website and Android mobile application is bringing all the local decorative paint companies of Karachi who have limited resources to carryout e-commerce operations on a single online platform. This would not only assist in increasing their sales and reaching out to more consumers but it will also ease the process of buying paints for consumers.

The paint preview feature that is designed using image processing technique will help consumers in choosing the right paint colour shade before buying paints which will reduce the wastage of resources (time, money, labour). With color balancing consumer is able to get the paint color shade virtually as close to its real-life counterpart.

This application is a final year project of BS(Software Engineering) students from the Batch SE-2018 of Department of CS & Software Engineering, Jinnah University for Women.

This repository contains only source code of web application of the project and not mobile application.

Attached is a complete FYP report of the project.
